# Cochleas analysis

The cochleas are organs inside our ears. They look like spirals, as can be seen in the following image.

[Axel Bellec](https://github.com/Belekkk) and I had a university assignement where we had to determine if the gender of an individual could be inferred by studying one of it's cochleas.

Each cochlea is represented by 1000 3D points. With these we built a 1000x1000 distance matrix for each gender and extracted significant distances.

The full report is available in French as a PDF in the folder.
